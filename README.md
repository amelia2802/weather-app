## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- Search for weather information by entering a location in the search bar
- View current weather conditions including temperature, weather icon, and location details
- See additional weather metrics like "feels like" temperature, humidity percentage, wind speed, and precipitation amounts
- Browse a 7-day weather forecast with daily high/low temperatures and weather icons
- View an hourly forecast showing temperature changes throughout the day
- Switch between different days of the week using the day selector in the hourly forecast section
- View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page

## My process

### Built with

- Tailwind CSS
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) - React framework
- [Open-Meteo API](https://open-meteo.com/) - Weather API

### What I learned

The main challenges I faced were fetching the API properly and the lack of understanding between the generic API URL and geo-coding API, as well as how to render and display the data on the webpage. I also used React to create the project, so I made several components, and passing the same value without repetition was tricky because siblings can't share values directly. So, I researched more about component hierarchy and passing values. I also struggled with displaying hour, time, and day formats initially, but I learned and applied those, along with calculating how to display weather codes, hourly weather, and times.

### Continued development
- Make the units button work to change the metrics
- Complete some other stretch goals like changing the background images according to the weather, adding a section to add and compare saved locations etc
